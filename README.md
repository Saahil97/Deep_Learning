#### 1. Regular Neural Network (ANN)
##### DATASET USED : CHURN MODELLING 
##### DESCRIPTION OF DATASET : This data set contains details of a bank's customers and the target variable is a binary variable reflecting the fact whether the customer left the bank (closed his account) or he continues to be a customer.
##### PROBLEM STATEMENT : To help the bank from losing any more customers. We can build an ANN model which can give us a prediction on any given customer if he/she is willing to leave the bank.
